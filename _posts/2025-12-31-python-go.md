There was a time when I found Python scary. This is understandable - according to AI Overview, Python carry diseases including chlamydia and leptospirosis. I used SQL, SAS and VBA professionally, and even picked up R to do some machine learning. Then one day, I decided to face my fears and learn Python. All the cool kids were doing it, and I wanted to use some fancy AI models that only ran in Python. These days, I feel one with Python[^1]. But when someone suggested I should go to a Golang meetup, those same fears resurfaced. There's only 64 squares on a Chess board. A Go board has 361. 

## Introduction

In this post, I'll do some Data Science-y stuff in Python and then try and repeat the exercise in Golang. The main aims of this are:

* show some side-by-side comparisons of the code and use this to discuss some of the differences between the languages more generally
* discuss the sorts of things each language is good at, and use this to answer the question, should Data Scientists learn Golang?

Just kidding. This is actually a placeholder for an article I am hoping to write soon. For now, I'm just putting a few dummy pages on the site to see how it feels.

If you think this post sounds interesting, or if there's something else you think I might be interested in blogging about, why not get in touch and let me know. There's contact links at the bottom of the sidebar.
