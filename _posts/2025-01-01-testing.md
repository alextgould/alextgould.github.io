This page is designed for testing and should be disabled by removing the date from the file name before production. It's also a template for future posts with some basic structural elements to make posts more engaging by minimising my verbal meandering.

> This is a blockquote. As an aside, the first few sentences in the blog post are displayed in the main page, and blockquotes are picked up. So having a banner at the top that says something like "Currently being updated" might seem ok (if you've spent enough time in Azure-land) but it will look bad on the home page.

Opening Statement (Hook). The goal of this is to grab attention and set the tone. This could be an interesting fact, a question, or a personal anecdote. For example, " Have you ever wondered why X always happens when Y is true? I recently experienced it firsthand…"

## Introduction

Introduction. Briefly outline the topic and why it matters. A quick overview of what the post will cover setting expectations. Keep it concise - just 1 to 2 paragraphs is often enough. For example, "In this post, I’ll explain how you can solve problem X using tool Y. Whether you’re new to this or looking for advanced tips, you’ll find something useful."

## Main Content (Body)

Goal of this section is to deliver the bulk of the information in an organised way. Use headings/subheadings to break up your content, making it scannable and letting readers jump to what interests them.

### Aussie Bogans are entertaining

Use descriptive, engaging headings that tell the reader what to expect (or not) in each section.

### Are they really? Why do we care?

Consider making your headings questions...

### What you need to know about Aussie Bogans

...or derivatives (clearly this is why I did Math at uni)

Also remember to use
* bullet points
  * lists
* examples (e.g. me)
* evidence or details that supoport your argument or explanation (e.g. wearing thongs... calling thongs thongs... wearing thongs on my feet...)

And engaging elements such as images/videos/examples:

And then finally... use transitions (spoiler alert: we're almost done)

## Conclusion

Wrap up and reinforce the main takeaway (probably Thai), key points, next steps, call to action etc.
