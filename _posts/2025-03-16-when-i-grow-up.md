## Introduction

I suspect for many people, their current job is the byproduct of a series of somewhat random choices and actions, based loosely on the answer to the question "what are your favourite subjects at school?", and extrapolated, one thing leading to another, until they find themselves in their current job. Their future job, by induction, also has a fair degree of randomness involved. 

Perhaps it makes sense that we don't try to plan too far into the future; life is uncertain and the world we live in is changing rapidly. When someone asked a young version of me "what do you want to be when you grow up?", I said I wanted to be an Accountant. At the time, there were no Data Scientists or Data Engineers, and machine learning (and the internet for that matter) was still in its infancy. Did it even matter what I answered?

I believe so. I became an Actuary - pretty close to being an Accountant. Within the insurance industry, Actuaries were the traditional Data Scientists - the area I've been pursuing. I had a broad vision for where I wanted to go, and while this adapted over time as the world changed and I grew up, I still ended up broadly where I set out to be.

It's worth taking the time to reflect on your long term goals. Even though the world may change, long term goals provide inspiration for short term goals. Short term goals motivate you to take short term actions that can move you closer to that vision of where you want to be. Without a clear vision, your actions will be motivated by dopamine hits (i.e. what your inner monkey feels like doing) and what others want from you.

I anticipate most of the posts to this blog will be technical, but this one will be a bit more personal. I'll talk through my career plan and how this blog fits into the broader picture of what I'm trying to do with my life. Along the way, I'll share some insights based on my career path, and perhaps you will learn something that will help you to steer your career in a better direction than it otherwise might be heading. 

Let's start by talking about the process I went through to figure out a career plan.

## The career planning process

A friend recently reached out and asked me to join them in following the process outlined in the book [Never Search Alone](https://www.phyl.org/) by Phyl Terry. 

The key features of this process are:

1. Setting up a "Job Search Council" - finding people to go on the journey with, providing emotional support and acting as a sounding board
2. Deciding on a destination - this sounds easy, and the end product (a 1-2 page document) makes it seem that way - but it's a long and iterative process filled with introspection and feedback
3. Creating a realistic strategy to move towards your end goal, balancing what you want with what the market wants from you
4. Networking, interviewing and negotiating

This post will mainly focus on the career plan document which was a key outcome of steps (2) and (3). I'll skip the details of how these steps work in practice (you can read the book or ask ChatGPT for a summary), other than to note that I found it both exciting and challenging meeting with people, sharing and iterating on a document that attempts to reflect who or what I am and what I might want to be. It was also noteworthy that not everyone shares the same understanding of words such as Data Scientist or DevOps, so the semantic details can be surprisingly important.

While early iterations of my career plan were several pages long and included a range of categories such as likes/dislikes, strengths/weaknesses, must have/avoid, want to have/avoid, long/short term goals, my current version only includes the career goals, must/want to haves and strengths. It was a useful exercise to reflect on all these factors, but in the end, many of the categories were simply used as stepping stones to arrive at a concise and positive expression of what I'm looking for.

For this post I'll talk through long term goals, and how these fed into my short term goals and my must haves.

## Long term goals

Here are my long term career goals:

1. **Flexible skillset** - Have sufficient depth of experience in Data/AI that I can add value across different industry sectors (e.g. AgTech, MedTech, Robotics, IoT, Smart Cities)
2. **Technical leadership** - feel confident acting as a technical team leader or founder, building quality products while helping others to grow their technical abilities

Having worked as an Actuary for around 15 years, I made the decision to undertake a postgraduate degree in Data Science. At the time, I had two goals: I wanted to access other industry sectors and work on what I perceived to be more interesting and world impacting problems outside of insurance; and I wanted to have more "hands on" experience in areas such as machine learning that would allow me to be a more effective technical team leader into the future. 

I finished my degree, but I didn't immediately land a role. My wife was working full time, we had two young kids and we were investing a lot of time in giving them great life opportunities, there were some significant and prolonged family medical issues, and we were in the middle of the Covid years - let's just say I had a few good excuses for not networking or actively looking for roles as much as I could have been. I was also a mature age worker looking for part-time roles in areas that I didn't have the necessary domain expertise or experience in. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better for me to go back into an Actuarial/insurance role with some pathway into the data science space. I felt quite averse to this approach; deep down thought I would wind up back where I started (with my tail between my legs and carrying a heavy suitcase filled with regrets). I did a bit of ad-hoc consulting, and eventually landed a role in a new Data & AI practice, although this was short-lived (for reasons largely outside my control).

It was only in the process of reflecting on my long term career goals that I was reminded of my mindset five years ago, when I decided to undertake the degree. The goals I settled on above are true to this mindset, reminding and motivating me to stay my course. There's also a few key phrases tucked in there:

* **depth of experience** - When applying for roles, having case studies and demonstrable expertise is key to establishing credibility and feeling confident doing the work; this is a reminder that I want to work on things that are good to talk about and that tick the boxes on skills that will set me up for interesting work in the future.

* **technical team leader** - This reminds me of my desire to be an effective team leader who has the technical knowledge to add real value to my team, rather than being a figurehead, prison guard or receptionist; it's a motivation to gain technical depth, but also a reminder to continue to leverage and develop my people skills along the way.

* **founder** - I don't know where I'll be in 10 years when my kids are grown up, but I like the idea that I could have a great idea, then DIY a MVP and build a business out of it. I think there's a lot of people out there with great ideas that don't have all the skills needed to build the product around it, and unless you're loaded with cash and 110% sure that the idea is a winner, you're probably not going to have the confidence to hire the team needed to give it a go. This term reminds me that building an end-to-end skillset, such as getting some Data Engineering or web application development and deployment experience, might open such doors in the future.

* **quality products** - There's a fairly low barrier to entry when it comes to coding, and particularly in the Actuarial world where the focus was historically on other relevant aspects such as the math, modelling, communication and legislation, there's a lot of analytics going on in environments that simply aren't efficient, scalable or well documented; I think phrases such as "best practice" get thrown around, but I'm increasingly of the view that having a strong and scalable foundation is vital for long term success.

With these long term goals in place, it became easier to define some short term goals that are a step in that direction.

## Short term goals

Here are my short term career goals: 

1. **Depth and credibility** - Apply my Data Science expertise to specific products/projects, to build a strong portfolio of case studies

2. **Collaboration** - Work in a role where I can leverage my experience and interpersonal skills to build bridges between developers and other stakeholders

3. **Best practices** - Work in a team that applies best practices in software development and deployment

The first goal on depth and credibility ties in with the earlier comments about the need to have case studies and demonstrable expertise in order to establish trust and feel confident doing the work. I have a decent amount of general knowledge picked up over the years, and I'm fairly confident I have the "hacker" mindset and general intelligence to be able to solve most technical problems that come my way. I also have some recent educational qualifications - you would think a 95% average mark in a postgraduate Data Science degree and a couple of associate-level Azure qualifications would count for something - but I'm not it does - either to a potential employer or to me. Hence, a big short term focus for me is in finding projects/roles where I can apply my skills in a manner that produces compelling case studies to open up more opportunities in the future.

The second goal on collaboration ties in with the long term goal around people leadership. While my current focus is on building my technical portfolio, several of the people I met with highlighted my consulting experience and people skills as a key strength. I'm conscious of the breath vs depth tradeoff that means I will likely struggle to be as good at Data Engineering or Machine Learning as a specialist. Hence, finding a role where I can make a technical contribution in one area while also adding value by helping the team work together more effectively feels like a good approach.

The final goal on best practices ties in with the earlier comments about quality products. I believe quality foundations drive long term success, so I feel more confident joining a team that shares this value. I'm also humbled by my Actuarial background; to fill in the gaps in the broader computer science skillset I am seeking to develop, the most efficient approach will be surrounding myself with a team that already has this expertise.

Having long term and short term goals established makes it easier to decide on a few key things that you "must have" in a job that's going to help you achive your goals. 

## Must haves

Here are my "must haves":

* **Tangible outcomes** - working on specific product(s) or projects
* **Technical expertise** - peers/project managers with experience that I can learn from

These may seem simple, but they were actually something of a revelation for me personally.

Given my background, a lot of the job opportunities I am likely to be offered and/or suitable for are with consulting companies who want someone with a general skillset and consulting experience, so they can reactively deliver whatever a company will pay them to do. Alternatively, companies may be looking to hire Data Scientists simply because they are aspiring to do more in the space, without necessarily knowing *what* they want to do. The Data Science function may sit across the company, effectively being an in-house consultancy. 

In both cases, this is a risky proposition for me, because I won't necessarily be working on projects that make for good case studies or allow me to develop relevant skills. I particularly want to avoid advisory work that results in "insights" for decision makers, where it's difficult to measure outcomes, which is a key feature of a good case study. My personal take on Data Science and my existing skillset is that this is actually a fairly likely end-product.

I may also be positioned as "the expert", reducing the chance that I'm surrounded by people with actual expertise that will contribute to my becoming a more effective technical leader in the future.

I won't share my "want to have" list. They mainly relate to flexibility, culture and remuneration. They're all fairly standard are really are balancing items which are up for negotiation. Job hunting is like house hunting - there are so many different factors to optimise for that you'll inevitably end up with some of what you want and miss out on other things, and price is a key balancing item in the equation.

## Specific skills

A key feature of my career goals was the development of a flexible skillset and case studies to demonstrate these skills. Without wanting to be overly prescriptive, I thought it would be useful to be a more specific about what skills I'm looking to develop. Writing these down will help me better assess potential projects/roles and ensure they align with my goals.

Firstly, I want to focus on building depth and credibility in the **machine learning** space (including generative AI). I have a good foundation of knowledge and some experience, but I need to work on more projects to gain confidence and build up a portfolio of interesting case studies.

Secondly, I want to strengthen the general IT knowledge that wraps around what I think of as Data Science. I think this can happen over time, if I'm looking out for projects/roles/people that cover these aspects. There are three broad areas I'm interested in:

* Data Engineering - prerequisite for Data Science and data-centric products
  - cloud-native services (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure) - managing VMs, data storage, isolated networks, user/group security
  - creating and using APIs to move data between applications and various storage sites
  - creating data lakes, data warehouses and databases (i.e. having input into design decisions, rather than just using them)
  - big data technologies (e.g. Spark, Databricks)

* Deployment (DevOps, MLOps) - to ensure processes are scalable and avoid repetitive manual work
  - CI/CD (e.g. Jenkins)
  - version control (e.g. Git)
  - infrastructure-as-code (e.g. Terraform)
  - containerisation (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes)
  - orchestration (e.g. Airflow)

* Application development - to allow cool ideas/code/models to become real products
  - languages besides Python (e.g. Go)
  - backend APIs to serve ML models (e.g. FastAPI)
  - web-based applications (e.g. Streamlit)

Each of these areas can potentially make me a better Data Scientist; being able to do more yourself and/or collaborate more effectively with others involved in the broader process can only create more opportunities for interesting Data Science applications. They're also potentially good career paths in themselves.

## Next steps for me

Despite feeling more confident in my career plan, I still need to figure out how to balance the time and energy required for my personal and home life with my career aspirations. I'm currently still spending a lot of time on family and personal activities, and I need to see if I can be more disciplined in channeling more of that into productive activities. A key piece of feedback given to me by multiple people was simply to *do something*, as anything is better than nothing. With so many potential directions, it's easy to spend too much time optimising and actually wind up doing nothing. 

One of the main aims of this post was to make a **public** commitment - to increase the chance that I will succeed in my aspirations, by creating a personal sense of accountability and by increasing the number of people who might hold me accountable more directly.

My intentions at this point are to:

* create content for this blog, focusing my effort on creating bite-sized projects to gain and demonstrate skills (rather than spending 20 years trying to create artificial general intelligence in my basement) and make it easier to share what I've done with others

* be more active in networking (e.g. attending meetups), leveraging my efforts by adapting blog posts for presenting at events

* be more earnest in keeping on top of advertised roles, understanding the required skills and finding a way to demonstrate these, if not through my prior experience, then by creating projects which I can blog about

It's still early days, but I'm optimistic that this approach will bring me closer to my long term career goals.

## Next steps for you

Most of the people I talked to when seeking feedback on my career plan also expressed a desire to make a change in their own career. This surprised me, but based on this, I suspect you might also be in this boat. 

If so, you might like to try out the [Never Search Alone](https://www.phyl.org/) process, which incidentally isn't just for the unemployed, but is actually intended for people looking to move into their next role or even make changes in their current role.

A lesser version of this would be to simply spend some time reflecting on where you're currently headed, and if you don't like the destination, consider making some small course corrections. Finding other people to talk to about this can give you a more balanced perspective, or even a reality check; the grass is often greener and it's easy to get swept up in the first idea that pops into your head, thinking it will solve all your problems.

If I could give some advice to my younger self, it would be to try and be more **intentional** in your approach to the projects/roles you take on and the personal/career tradeoffs you're making. There probably isn't an optimal solution to life, but if you're out at sea, you're more likely to reach the island if you give yourself a paddle rather than hoping that the currents take you there.
