Whatever happened to Friday night at the movies, where the entire country came together to watch the same movie (which was likely a repeat of a movie you'd watched at least three times) while taking syncronised toilet and snack breaks every 10 minutes during the ad breaks?

Like it or not, the future has arrived, and the ABC is on a mission to become a digital-first organisation with personalised content for its audiences. Their ABC Digital Product team hosts a [blog](https://www.abc.net.au/digital-product) which covers some of what's been happening in recent years.

## Introduction

In this post, I'll respond to some of the Digital Product Team's posts, with a view to:

* gain and demonstrate familiarity with what the ABC is doing in the space
* for ongoing projects, identify potential questions for the team to consider, such as potential pitfalls or alternative approaches
* for completed projects, ask some interesting followup questions, that the team can perhaps answer for me and others who are curious

Some relevant blog posts include:

Just kidding. This is actually a placeholder for an article I am hoping to write soon. For now, I'm just putting a few dummy pages on the site to see how it feels.
