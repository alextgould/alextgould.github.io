## Executive Summary

In this post:
* I give an overview of the LoL Monitor tool, which monitors for League of Legends windows, closing the lobby after each game and enforcing breaks
* I talk about the Go programming language that I used to build the tool, and contrast it with the Python language with which I have more experience

## Introduction

Opening Statement (Hook). The goal of this is to grab attention and set the tone. This could be an interesting fact, a question, or a personal anecdote. For example, " Have you ever wondered why X always happens when Y is true? I recently experienced it firsthand…"

Briefly outline the topic and why it matters. A quick overview of what the post will cover setting expectations. Keep it concise - just 1 to 2 paragraphs is often enough. For example, "In this post, I’ll explain how you can solve problem X using tool Y. Whether you’re new to this or looking for advanced tips, you’ll find something useful."

This page is designed for testing and should be disabled by removing the date from the file name before production. It's also a template for future posts with some basic structural elements to make posts more engaging by minimising my verbal meandering.

## The post game lobby window

There are two options coming out of a game of League of Legends, and both are bad news for moderation.

Option 1: Victory! You're on a dopamine high, you're feeling great, this game makes you feel great, and there's a button that says "Would you like some more?". Hell yes I want some more. Play another game.

Option 2: Defeat! You played poorly and you're feeling shame, guilt, frustration. Or you played well, but you lost anyway; your teammates were underperforming, your team ignored your call and hung you out to dry, your team fought at a numbers disadvantage while you weren't there. It feels unfair and you're feeling frustrated. Either way, the easiest way to make these negative feelings go away is to sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened. Next game you'll be better, or your team will perform better. Play another game.

In both cases, the main problem is that there's a big button that continues the endless cycle. It's like doom scrolling on social media or autoplay on YouTube. You need something to help you break the cycle. You need a moment so you can pause, reset and make a more logical decision rather than making an emotional one. You need that button to go away.

## Main Content (Body)

Goal of this section is to deliver the bulk of the information in an organised way. Use headings/subheadings to break up your content, making it scannable and letting readers jump to what interests them.

### Aussie Bogans are entertaining

Use descriptive, engaging headings that tell the reader what to expect (or not) in each section.

### Are they really? Why do we care?

Consider making your headings questions...

### What you need to know about Aussie Bogans

...or derivatives (clearly this is why I did Math at uni)

Also remember to use
* bullet points
  * lists
* examples (e.g. me)
* evidence or details that supoport your argument or explanation (e.g. wearing thongs... calling thongs thongs... wearing thongs on my feet...)

And engaging elements such as images/videos/examples:

And then finally... use transitions (spoiler alert: we're almost done)

## Conclusion

Wrap up and reinforce the main takeaway (probably Thai), key points, next steps, call to action etc.[^1]
