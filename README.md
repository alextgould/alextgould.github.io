# Alex's blog repo

![](assets/img/testing/anime_god_4_wide.jpg)

This blog uses the free Github Pages service and is rendered automatically using Jekyll whenever I commit to the main branch. The layout is based on the free [Flexible-Jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) template with a few changes.

See [devlog.md](devlog.md) for more details on how this was all set up - at some point I may write a blog post about this topic.

# Local testing

To test the file locally (having installed Ruby with Devkit):

```bundle exec jekyll serve```

This opens a server which you can open using the link in the terminal output.

# Draft posts

There are draft posts in the [_posts](_posts) folder that don't have a yyyy-mm-dd prefix which aren't included in the Jekyll build.

The dev branch is being used for seeing how the blog looks with a draft of the article I'm currently writing.

# Images

Most of the images in my blog were generated using [leonardo.ai](leonardo.ai), a generative AI tool.

Pro tip for cost sensitive individuals: I only wanted to try it out, so I went with a one month subscription using a 20% discount code (probably LEO20). I then tried to cancel my subscription to avoid it rolling over automatically, and after declining a few offers, they gave me a free month to defer doing this. So I set myself a calendar reminder, and I'm now trying it out for 2 months at AUD $5 per month.

The 8,500 credits they give you allows you to do a fair amount (I've used up less than 2,000 so far). It's early days and I'm still very new to this space, but my early recommendation to anyone trying this out would be to experiment with the canvas editor, as you'll generate a LOT of images that aren't quite right if you only massage the prompt, but using the editor makes it easy to fix these little things. At some point if I continue using this tool I may do a blog post on it.
